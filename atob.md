## Frequently asked questions
### Can I use AtoB on more than fuel?
Yes! AtoB is accepted at 99%+ of gas stations and truck stops, enabling widespread fuel and non-fuel acceptance. What’s more the AtoB card can be used for vehicle or business related expenses including maintenance, tolls, tires, and much more. You can easily set your own rules and restrictions on what spend limits, locations and product categories you want the AtoB card to be used for. And you can change the restrictions simply and at any time.
### Can I port my fleet’s existing discount to the AtoB card?
Yes, AtoB can port existing discounts at any merchant that is already in AtoB's partner network (e.g., TA Petro, Speedway, Racetrac, Love’s, etc.). We currently do not offer the option to port discounts from Pilot Flying J, although this may change in the future.
### Do you have a fraud prevention guarantee?
Yes, up to $250,000 based on eligibility and fleet size. Our fraud and fuel theft prevention suite stops fraudulent use of the AtoB fuel cards before fraud happens.AtoB cards can be locked by default, and can only be unlocked by authorized drivers and fleet admins.
This prevents any kind of cyber fraud, card skimming, or other stolen card use, as the cards and card info is unusable without the unlocking action.
With telematics integration, we can validate GPS location of the vehicle being fueled and the merchant where fuel is being purchased, as well as dynamically modify authorizations based on the vehicle's fuel tank level. This prevents theft from authorized users who are bad actors.
### What type of reporting do you provide?
AtoB provides fleet managers with access to detailed reporting tools to eliminate fuel theft, benchmark vehicle and driver performance and costs, improve fuel economy and routing efficiency, and manage their fleet’s cost of fueling. A robust set of data is captured for each transaction:
  * **Merchant data** : Merchant category, merchant name and brand, street address, and latitude/longitude.
  * **Purchase data:** Total purchase amount, fuel type/grade, fuel cost per gallon, number of gallons, and receipt line item details for non-fuel purchases.
  * **Telematics data:** Vehicle location at time of purchase, vehicle fuel tank levels before and after fueling event, driver location at time of purchase (opt-in).
  * **Pricing data:** Retail and discounted price per gallon at the selected station and any nearby stations at time of purchase.


Fleet managers can download detailed transaction reporting by time period and by card, driver, vehicle, or department; and access summarized reports and insights on suspicious transactions, optimal fueling opportunities, and driver/vehicle performance benchmarking on their dashboard.
For OTR customers who are required to file a quarterly IFTA report, fleet managers can:
  * Download a report of IFTA-eligible transactions, including gallons purchased by vehicle by jurisdiction.
  * Automatically send data for IFTA-eligible transactions to their integrated telematics platform such as Samsara, to automate preparation of their IFTA filing with vehicle and purchase data.


### How can the AtoB card prevent fraud when I spend on more than fuel?
Spend controls and merchant category restrictions are managed by fleet admins and allow fleets to prevent use of cards in unauthorized categories (e.g., a fuel-only program can be implemented). Spend controls can be adjusted or changed by the Fleet Manager on the fly through the AtoB web portal. This is especially handy if a driver has a breakdown and requires emergency roadside repair or towing.
### Do you offer credit?
Yes, AtoB offers both a credit and prepaid spend card to tens of thousands of fleets today. AtoB can provide credit commensurate with fuel usage and business revenue. We offer free, monthly reporting to Experian to help you strengthen your credit profile and open doors for better financing in the future. Credit application is fast and simple and does not require a hard credit check. Simply apply and we’ll offer you credit if you qualify.
### How do I add or change a spend limit or rule on the spend card?
Fleet managers can easily - across all cards, groups of cards, or for a single card, driver, or vehicle - perform the following actions directly from the Customer dashboard:
  * **Set spend limits** , including per transaction, daily, and weekly limits.  

  * **Set operational hours** , to specify days of the week / hours of the day for which cards should be activated, for fleets that use shifts or only operate during certain times.
  * **Manage category restrictions** : Limit purchases to specific merchants, or block purchases at specific merchants, for finer controls based on the Merchant ID.
  * **Manage out-of-network acceptance** : Limit purchases to in-network locations only; or allow access to out-of-network merchants.
  * **Manage merchant restrictions** : Limit purchases to specific merchants, or block purchases at specific merchants, for finer controls based on the Merchant ID.


### What if I need to send money to a driver that’s stuck or runs into a problem?
AtoB offers a variety of instant transfer methods for fleet managers to send funds to drivers with 24/7/365 availability, for a 1% fee. Managers can select between Venmo, PayPal, push to debit, as well as a new Pay by email or text feature, where funds can be sent by email or phone number and the recipient can select the destination of funds.
### Is AtoB a bank?
No, AtoB is not a bank, however AtoB maintains wallet accounts with an FDIC insured bank.
